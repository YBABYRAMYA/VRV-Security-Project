## 🛠️ Deployment

### Deploying with Waitress

[Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/) is a production-ready WSGI server for serving Python web applications.

### Steps to Deploy with Waitress

1. **Install Waitress**:
   Install the Waitress server via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install waitress
   ```

2. **Modify the Entry Point**:
   Ensure your `app.py` file exposes the Flask application object as `app`. For example:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route("/")
   def home():
       return "Welcome to Flask Authentication System with RBAC!"
   ```

3. **Run the Application with Waitress**:
   Start the Waitress server to serve your app:
   ```bash
   waitress-serve --listen=0.0.0.0:8080 app:app
   ```
   - Replace `8080` with the desired port if necessary.
   - Ensure the `app:app` format matches the file name (`app.py`) and the Flask app object (`app`).

4. **Access Your Application**:
   Navigate to your server's URL and port in the browser:
   ```
   http://<server-ip>:8080/
   ```

### Optional: Running Waitress in the Background
To keep the server running even after logging out of the terminal, you can use a process manager like **`nohup`** or **`systemd`**.

#### Using `nohup`:
```bash
nohup waitress-serve --listen=0.0.0.0:8080 app:app &
```
